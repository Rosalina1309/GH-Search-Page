# GitHub Search Page

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Rosie. and welcome to my GitHub Search Page where you can find an user's Github account by their name, see all of their repositories and even be able to search for the specific one by its name or the language you are interested in.

This React App is written with Typescript, Vanilla CSS and I ultilized the GitHub API which I found the endpoints I need here:
 https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-app-installation-access-tokens?apiVersion=2022-11-28

I divided the components and tried to implement seperate of concern pattern, which is a design principle that manages complexity by partitioning the software system so that each partition is responsible for a separate concern, minimizing the overlap of concerns as much as possible.


## How to run the app
 
 Please run the commands on the terminal in the root folder
